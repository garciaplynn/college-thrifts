# College Thrifts MVP
This project was created in React in collaboration with Patricia Garcia and the \_Nology Borneo intake.

We were given 4 weeks to complete this product using paired progamming and working in an Agile environment.


The 6 Epics for this project were prioratised as follow:

1. Clothing Rail
2. Profile 
3. Settings 
4. CO2 Tracker
5. Messaging
6. Sign Up

## Completion

Navbar:

On each page there is a fully functioning Navbar.

1. Clothing rail: 

The Clothing rail was the first section to be completed including swipe functionality.

2. Profile:

The Profile page was completed including a toggle function that displays items that you have liked. It also included a link to the settings page.

3. Settings:

The Settings link directs you to a private profile page allowing you to edit your visible profile.

4. CO2 Tracker:

The CO2 Tracker page was completed solely stylistically, usimg Chart.js to show how it would display.

5. Messageing:

It was agreed that Messaging page had a lower priority than the previous Epics. Therefore, it was agreed to only display the how the messaging page would look.

6. Sign Up:

The Sign Up page was given the lowest priority and due to time constraints it was not completed.









### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
